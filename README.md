# Experimenting react-admin with Typescript

The goal of this project is to re-implement part of the posters-demo in order to learn react-admin 
and Typescript

We use types instead of interfaces, as recommended by
[Konstantin Lebedev](https://konstantinlebedev.com/type-aliases-vs
-interfaces/) and
[Martin Hotell](https://medium.com/@martin_hotell/10-typescript-pro-tips-patterns-with-or-without-react
-5799488d6680) (tip #19)

We also use "normal function" syntax, instead of FunctionComponent, as recommended by [React Typescript Cheatsheet
](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets
/react-typescript
-cheatsheet)
